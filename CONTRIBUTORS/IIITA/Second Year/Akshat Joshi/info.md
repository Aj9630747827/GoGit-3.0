Answer to question->
Git doesn't need any specific branch.
Older versions of Git (and thus GitHub), used to create a "master" branch by default. In later versions, the default branch was renamed to "main", in order to use more inclusive language.
From a technical perspective, you could keep both, decide on one, or even drop them both and decide your default branch is called SpongeBob.
